                <div class="about-p">
                    <p>
                    Delfinia is a mother to two adult sons. She is the daughter of Joe 
                    and Gloria; her inspirational mentors. Her parents were not formally 
                    educated. They however, were responsible for instilling the importance of
                    higher education, and integrity in personal and professional life. 
                    She is an independently licensed psychotherapist and a Certified EMDR 
                    (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) trauma therapist. 
                    She is certified in DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy).

                    <p>
                    Her goal is to support clients in adapting the belief that hope exists; and,
                    where they are currently is where they need to be, but not where they have 
                    to remain. Her own trauma history presents as an empathetic conduit 
                    in her role as therapist. Delfinia is fluent in Spanish and has been 
                    providing bilingual treatment support since 2007. She has
                    engaged with the most challenged families and individuals in Albuquerque 
                    and Rio Rancho. Her experience and skills in family therapy includes 
                    supporting co-parenting/blended families, partner/marital issues, and 
                    defiant adolescent behaviors to name a few. Her individual
                    therapy experience includes treatment of anxiety, depression, PTSD, 
                    schizophrenia, self-harming behaviors/suicidality, substance abuse, 
                    and trauma (Individual and generational). She finds practicing EMDR, 
                    Ego States, Cognitive Behavioral (CBT), Motivational Interviewing,
                    and Strategic/Structured modes of treatment effective, among others.  
                    Her personal therapy style is direct, honest, and person-centered. 
                    She was an MST (Multi-systemic Treatment)
                    therapist for 15 years. Her Professional association includes being a 
                    full-time member of EMDRIA (EMDR Association).
